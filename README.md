## CodSoft AI Internship
Overview
This repository contains the work I completed during my AI internship at CodSoft, where I explored various AI/ML concepts and developed three key projects:

1. Rule-Based Chatbot
2. Tic-Tac-Toe AI
4. Recommendation System
Each task provided hands-on experience with AI principles, rule-based logic, game theory, and machine learning techniques.
